# Vector aggregator demo

## How to start it

```shell
docker-compose up --detach
```

This starts up the full scenario in the background, which includes:

* A Vector [aggregator] configured to handle logs from a variety of downstream agents:
  * 3 Vector [agents][agent] emitting HTTP server logs as JSON
  * 3 Vector agents emitting Syslog logs
  * 3 [Fluent-Bit] agents emitting logs generated by the `random` source

You can see the aggregator output in real-time by running this command:

```shell
docker-compose logs --follow aggregator
```
